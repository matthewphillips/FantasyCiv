The goal of this project is to create a topdown civilation like game with fantasy elements and story.  This project came out of a desire to create a civilization game that eschewed some of the longstanding tropes of those games.
After reviewing some games, I realized that a mesh between classic fantasy games and a civ like resource management/growth/war/diplomacy game is glaringly absent from the industry.

At the start, my goal is to develop the basic gameplay mechanics.
